### 💫 About Me:
👩‍💻 Current Computer Science student with a minor in Korean Localization & Translation. <br/>
🔭 My main interests lie in cyber security, but recently I am exploring the field of localization engineering and how I can combine technical skills with language and culture.<br/>
✨ Recently returned from a year abroad, so I am currently focused on rebuilding my foundational skills, while exploring which direction I want to go.<br/>
